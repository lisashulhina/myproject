# myproject

This program will input data from either a .csv file or a database.<br> 
You will choose 1 quantitative column and 1 categorical column to be analyzed.<br>
A histogram will be displayed showing the analysis of the 2 columns.

If you have errors importing mysql in functions.py,
you'll want to install the package 'mysql-connector-python', instead of just 'mysql'.
